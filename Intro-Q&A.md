Below is the **refined version you can directly speak**.

## ✅ Q1) Explain me your project? (Interview Answer)

> I worked on a **pharma inventory and batch traceability system** for **Novartis**.
> The application is used to manage pharmaceutical products, track drug batches, monitor inventory, handle expiry and recalls, and maintain audit logs for compliance.

> Users such as **Admin, Quality team, Warehouse, and Auditors** use the system.

> The system ensures that **expired or recalled medicines are not distributed**, and all critical actions are recorded for **regulatory audits**.
> It is built using **React for the frontend**, **Spring Boot for the backend**, **SQL for the database**, and deployed on **AWS**.

---

## ✅ Q2) What was your role and responsibilities within the project?

> I worked as a **Java Full Stack Developer**.
> My responsibilities included:

* Developing **Spring Boot REST APIs**
* Building **React UI components**
* Implementing **business validations** for batches and inventory
* Writing **unit tests** using JUnit and Mockito
* Fixing **production issues**
* Working closely with the team in **Agile Scrum**

## ✅ Q3) What is the use case implemented for Micro-Frontend?

### (Reporting & Audit Module – Simple Explanation)

### 🔹 Use Case

> We implemented **micro-frontend** for the **Reporting and Audit module**.

> It is a **read-only module**, used by **multiple teams**, and requires **frequent UI changes** like adding new reports, filters, and dashboards.

---

### 🔹 Why This Module Was Chosen

> Reporting and Audit is a **separate and shared application** used across different systems within the organization.
> It is commonly used by **Quality, Warehouse, Admin, and Audit teams**, which made it a good candidate for micro-frontend.

---

### 🔹 How Micro-Frontend Helped

> The Reporting and Audit UI was developed as a **separate application** and integrated into the **main container app**.
> This allowed the team to:

* Deploy reports **independently**
* Add new dashboards **without impacting other modules**
* Scale the reporting UI **separately**

---

### 🔹 Integration with Other Applications

> The Reporting and Audit micro-frontend consumed data from:

* **Quality systems** (batch status and recalls)
* **Warehouse systems** (inventory movements)
* Backend services using **common REST APIs**

> The micro-frontend handled only the **UI layer**, while all **business logic remained in the backend**.

---

## 🎯 One-Line Interview Summary

> We used micro-frontend for the Reporting and Audit module because it is a shared, read-only feature used by multiple teams and required independent UI deployment without impacting core inventory functionality.

---

### 🔥 Final Tip (Important)

If interviewer interrupts, just say:

> “Reporting and Audit was a shared, read-only module with frequent UI changes, so micro-frontend helped us deploy and scale it independently.”
