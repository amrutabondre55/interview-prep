## What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment (or Delivery)**.
It is a **DevOps practice** that automates **building, testing, and deploying code**.

---

## 1️⃣ Continuous Integration (CI)

### 🔹 What it means:

Developers **frequently merge code** into a shared repository, and every change is **automatically built and tested**.

### 🔹 What happens in CI:

* Code push to Git
* Automatic build
* Run unit tests
* Code quality checks

### 🔹 Why CI:

* Detects bugs early
* Avoids “it works on my machine” problems
* Keeps code always in a working state

👉 **One-line interview answer:**

> CI ensures that every code change is automatically built and tested.

---

## 2️⃣ Continuous Deployment / Delivery (CD)

### 🔹 What it means:

After CI passes, the code is **automatically deployed** to environments.

### 🔹 Difference:

* **Continuous Delivery:**
  Code is ready to deploy, **manual approval** needed
* **Continuous Deployment:**
  Code is **automatically deployed to production** without manual approval

👉 **One-line interview answer:**

> CD automates the release of tested code to servers or production.

## 🔄 CI/CD Flow (how to explain in interview)

```
Developer → Git Commit → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor
```

---

## 🛠 Common CI/CD Tools (name-dropping helps 😉)

* **CI:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI
* **CD:** Jenkins, ArgoCD, Spinnaker
* **Others:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS CodePipeline

---

## 🌍 Real-life analogy (easy to remember)

Imagine a **restaurant**:

* **CI:** Chef tastes food while cooking (testing early)
* **CD:** Food is served automatically once ready

## 🔟 Top 10 CI/CD Interview Questions & Answers

### 1️⃣ What is CI/CD?

**Answer:**
CI/CD is an automated process that continuously builds, tests, and deploys code, helping teams deliver software faster and with fewer errors.

---

### 2️⃣ What is Continuous Integration?

**Answer:**
Continuous Integration means frequently merging code into a shared repository where automated builds and tests run on every commit.

---

### 3️⃣ What is Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment?

**Answer:**
Continuous Delivery requires manual approval before production, while Continuous Deployment automatically releases code to production.

---

### 4️⃣ Why is CI/CD important?

**Answer:**
It detects bugs early, reduces manual work, improves deployment speed, and increases software reliability.

---

### 5️⃣ What are the stages of a CI/CD pipeline?

**Answer:**
Code → Build → Test → Package → Deploy → Monitor

---

### 6️⃣ Which CI/CD tools have you used?

**Answer:**
I have used Jenkins for pipelines, Git for version control, Docker for containerization, and AWS for deployment.

*(Change tools based on your experience)*

---

### 7️⃣ What is a pipeline in CI/CD?

**Answer:**
A pipeline is a sequence of automated steps that move code from commit to deployment.

---

### 8️⃣ What is rollback in CI/CD?

**Answer:**
Rollback is reverting to a previous stable version if a deployment fails.

---

### 9️⃣ How do you secure CI/CD pipelines?

**Answer:**
By using secrets management, access control, environment variables, and scanning for vulnerabilities.

---

### 🔟 What happens if a build fails in CI?

**Answer:**
The pipeline stops, developers are notified, and the issue is fixed before proceeding further.
