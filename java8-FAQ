Nice 👍 this is a **very common interview combo**.
Below are **INTERVIEW-READY questions on Lambda Expressions & Functional Interfaces** with **short, crisp answers** (easy to remember + speak).

# 🔥 **Lambda Expression & Functional Interface – Interview Questions**

---

## **1️⃣ What is a lambda expression?**

**Answer:**
A lambda expression is an **anonymous function** introduced in Java 8 to **implement functional interfaces** in a concise way.

---

## **2️⃣ What is a functional interface?**

**Answer:**
A functional interface is an interface that contains **exactly one abstract method**, and it is the **target type** for lambda expressions.

---

## **3️⃣ Can we use lambda expression without functional interface?**

**Answer:**
❌ No.
Lambda expressions **must be associated with a functional interface**.

---

## **4️⃣ Why functional interface has only one abstract method?**

**Answer:**
Because lambda expressions need **only one method to implement**.
Multiple abstract methods would create ambiguity.

---

## **5️⃣ What is `@FunctionalInterface` annotation?**

**Answer:**
It ensures at **compile time** that an interface has **only one abstract method**.
It is **optional but recommended**.

---

## **6️⃣ Can a functional interface have default methods?**

**Answer:**
✅ Yes.
A functional interface can have **any number of default and static methods**, but only **one abstract method**.

---

## **7️⃣ Difference between Lambda Expression and Anonymous Inner Class**

**Answer:**

| Lambda            | Anonymous Inner Class |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Less code         | More code             |
| No own `this`     | Has its own `this`    |
| Faster & readable | Slower & verbose      |
| Java 8 feature    | Before Java 8         |

---

## **8️⃣ Can lambda expression access local variables?**

**Answer:**
✅ Yes, but local variables must be **final or effectively final**.

---

## **9️⃣ Why local variables must be effectively final in lambda?**

**Answer:**
To avoid **thread-safety and consistency issues**, since lambdas may execute later.

---

## **🔟 Name some built-in functional interfaces**

**Answer:**

* `Predicate<T>`
* `Function<T, R>`
* `Consumer<T>`
* `Supplier<T>`
* `Runnable`
* `Comparator`

---

## **1️⃣1️⃣ Can lambda expression throw checked exception?**

**Answer:**
✅ Yes, **only if the functional interface method declares it**.

---

## **1️⃣2️⃣ Difference between Predicate and Function**

**Answer:**

* `Predicate` → returns **boolean**
* `Function` → returns **any value**

---

## **1️⃣3️⃣ Can we overload methods with lambda expressions?**

**Answer:**
❌ No, because lambda expressions do not have a **type of their own**.

---

## **1️⃣4️⃣ What is method reference? How is it related to lambda?**

**Answer:**
Method reference is a **shorter form of lambda expression** that refers to an existing method.

---

## **1️⃣5️⃣ Where do you use lambda in real projects?**

**Answer:**

* Stream API (`filter`, `map`)
* Sorting using `Comparator`
* Asynchronous programming
* Collection processing
