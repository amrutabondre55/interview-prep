# ✅ Top 25 React Interview Q&A (3 Years Experience)

---

## 1️⃣ What is React?

**Answer:**
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable, component-based architecture. It uses Virtual DOM for efficient UI updates.

---

## 2️⃣ What is Virtual DOM?

**Answer:**
Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. React compares the previous and current Virtual DOM and updates only the changed parts in the real DOM.

---

## 3️⃣ Difference between Props and State?

| Props                  | State                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Passed from parent     | Managed within component |
| Read-only              | Mutable                  |
| Used for configuration | Used for dynamic data    |

---

## 4️⃣ Functional vs Class Components?

**Answer:**
Functional components are simpler, use hooks for state and lifecycle, and are preferred over class components for better readability and performance.

---

## 5️⃣ What are Hooks?

**Answer:**
Hooks allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features without writing class components.

---

## 6️⃣ Explain `useState`

**Answer:**
`useState` is used to manage local component state and triggers re-render when the state changes.

---

## 7️⃣ Explain `useEffect`

**Answer:**
`useEffect` handles side effects like API calls, subscriptions, and timers. The dependency array controls when it executes.

---

## 8️⃣ What is dependency array in `useEffect`?

**Answer:**
It determines when the effect runs. Empty array runs once, no array runs on every render, values inside run when they change.

---

## 9️⃣ What is `useMemo`?

**Answer:**
`useMemo` memoizes expensive computations to avoid recalculating them on every render.

---

## 🔟 Difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?

**Answer:**
`useMemo` memoizes values, while `useCallback` memoizes functions.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ What is React.memo?

**Answer:**
React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders of a component by memoizing it based on props.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ How do you optimize React performance?

**Answer:**
Using React.memo, useCallback, useMemo, lazy loading, code splitting, and avoiding unnecessary state updates.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ What is controlled vs uncontrolled component?

**Answer:**
Controlled components manage input value using state. Uncontrolled components use refs to access DOM values.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ What is lifting state up?

**Answer:**
Moving shared state to the nearest common parent so multiple components can access and update it.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ What is Context API?

**Answer:**
Context API is used to pass data globally without prop drilling, commonly used for auth and theme management.

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ What is Redux and why use it?

**Answer:**
Redux is a predictable state management library used when application state becomes complex and shared across many components.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Difference between Context API and Redux?

**Answer:**
Context is for simple global state, Redux is better for complex state with middleware, debugging, and scalability.

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ How do you handle API calls in React?

**Answer:**
Using `fetch` or `axios` inside `useEffect` with loading and error states.

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ What is debouncing?

**Answer:**
Debouncing limits function execution until the user stops triggering an event, commonly used in search inputs.

---

## 2️⃣0️⃣ What is React Router?

**Answer:**
React Router enables navigation between different components in a single-page application without page reload.

---

## 2️⃣1️⃣ What are keys in React?

**Answer:**
Keys help React identify list items uniquely and improve rendering performance.

---

## 2️⃣2️⃣ What is lazy loading?

**Answer:**
Lazy loading loads components only when required, improving initial load performance.

---

## 2️⃣3️⃣ How do you handle authentication in React?

**Answer:**
Using JWT tokens, protected routes, role-based rendering, and secure API calls.

---

## 2️⃣4️⃣ What is Error Boundary?

**Answer:**
Error Boundaries catch JavaScript errors in child components and display fallback UI instead of crashing the app.

An Error Boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors in its child component tree and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application.

In simple words:
👉 It prevents the whole app from breaking when a component throws an error.

An Error Boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors in its child component tree and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application.

In simple words:
👉 It prevents the whole app from breaking when a component throws an error.
✅ Why do we need Error Boundaries?

Without Error Boundary:
One UI error → entire app crashes

With Error Boundary:
Error is caught
Fallback UI is shown
App continues running

Example use cases:
Dashboard widgets
Third-party components
Large UI sections

How Error Boundary works internally?
React provides lifecycle methods:
static getDerivedStateFromError()
componentDidCatch()

✅ How to explain in interview (short & crisp)
“Error Boundaries are React components used to catch runtime errors in child components and show a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole application. They improve application stability and user experience.”

✅ Real Project Example (Say this 🔥)
“In our hospital IT dashboard, we wrapped critical widgets like charts and tables with Error Boundaries so that if one widget failed, the rest of the dashboard continued to work.”
---


How to Handle Errors in Hooks (React)

Important rule (say this first):
Hooks cannot use Error Boundaries directly.
Errors must be handled manually inside hooks or wrapped by an Error Boundary at component level.

## 2️⃣5️⃣ How do you test React components?

**Answer:**
Using Jest and React Testing Library to test rendering, user interactions, and component behavior.
