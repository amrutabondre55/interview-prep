Got it 👍
Here are **AWS interview points** you can **say confidently** for a **3-year Full-Stack / React + Java dev** role.

---

## ☁️ AWS Important Interview Points (Crisp & Practical)

---

## 1️⃣ What is AWS?

> AWS is a cloud platform that provides on-demand computing services like servers, storage, databases, and networking on a pay-as-you-go model.

---

## 2️⃣ EC2 (Very Important)

**Use this line 👇**

> EC2 provides scalable virtual servers where we deploy backend applications like Spring Boot.

**Key points**

* Instance types (t2.micro, t3)
* Security Groups (acts like firewall)
* Key pair for SSH access

---

## 3️⃣ S3 (Frontend + Backend)

> S3 is an object storage service used to store static files like images, videos, logs, and React build files.

**Real usage**

* Host React app
* Store profile images
* Backup files

---

## 4️⃣ IAM (Must-Say in Interview)

> IAM is used to manage users, roles, and permissions securely in AWS.

**Say this**

* Never use root user
* Use roles for EC2 access
* Least privilege principle

---

## 5️⃣ RDS (Database)

> RDS is a managed database service that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.

**Benefits**

* Automated backup
* Scaling
* No manual DB maintenance

---

## 6️⃣ Load Balancer

> Load balancer distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances to improve availability and fault tolerance.

Types:

* Application Load Balancer (ALB)
* Network Load Balancer (NLB)

---

## 7️⃣ Auto Scaling

> Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases EC2 instances based on traffic.

**Example**

* More users → more servers
* Low traffic → fewer servers

---

## 8️⃣ CloudWatch (Monitoring)

> CloudWatch is used to monitor logs, CPU usage, memory, and set alarms.

**Real use**

* Debug production issues
* Monitor API failures

---

## 9️⃣ CI/CD (Bonus Point)

> We use AWS services like CodePipeline or GitHub Actions to automate build and deployment.

---

## 🔐 10️⃣ Security Best Practices

Say at least **2 of these**:

* Use IAM roles
* Security groups & NACL
* HTTPS using SSL
* Store secrets in environment variables

---

## 🎯 One-Minute AWS Summary (Say This!)

> I have used AWS mainly for deploying backend services on EC2, hosting static files on S3, managing databases with RDS, and controlling access using IAM. I also monitored applications using CloudWatch and ensured security using security groups and roles.
