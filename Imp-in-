Perfect question — this is a **very common interview favorite** 👍
Here’s an **interview-ready answer** you can speak confidently.

## Authentication vs Authorization (Interview Answer)

### 🔐 Authentication

**Authentication means verifying who the user is.**

In simple words, it checks **identity**.

Example:

* User enters **username and password**
* System verifies credentials
* If correct → user is authenticated

👉 Question it answers:
**“Who are you?”**

Real example:

> Login to Gmail using email & password.

---

### 🔑 Authorization

**Authorization means verifying what the user is allowed to do.**

It checks **permissions** after login.

Example:

* Admin can add users
* Normal user can only view data

👉 Question it answers:
**“What are you allowed to do?”**

Real example:

> In Gmail, user can read emails but cannot access admin settings.

---

## 🔄 Order (Very Important Point)

> **Authentication always happens first, Authorization happens next.**

You cannot authorize a user unless they are authenticated.

## 🧠 Real-Time Project Example (Strong Answer)

“In our application, we use **JWT-based authentication**.
When the user logs in, we validate credentials and generate a JWT token — this is authentication.
For every API request, the token is validated, and based on user roles like `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_USER`, access to APIs is controlled — this is authorization.”

## 📌 One-Line Difference (Easy to Remember)

| Authentication      | Authorization                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Who you are         | What you can do              |
| Login process       | Permission check             |
| Username & password | Roles & privileges           |
| Happens first       | Happens after authentication |

## ⚡ Ultra-Short Version (If interviewer wants quick answer)

> “Authentication verifies the user’s identity, while authorization determines what actions the authenticated user is allowed to perform.”
